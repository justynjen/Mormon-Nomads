    <p>Iâ€™m a digital nomad with a passion for writing, taking photos and helping others live their best life. I share personal travel stories as well as tips for finding the best wifi, cafes and working spaces around the world. I have been traveling for just about 3 years now and have been lucky enough to fund my traveling through working remote.
    <br>
    <br>
    My happiest days are spent sipping coffee at little cafes and exploring new cities around the world.
